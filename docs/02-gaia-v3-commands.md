# GAIA v3 Command Reference — HDB 630

All commands are Sennheiser vendor (`0x0495`) unless noted otherwise.

Response cmd = request cmd | 0x0100. Error cmd = request cmd | 0x0180.

## Device Info

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Get Serial | 0x0003 | - | ASCII string | Vendor: Qualcomm (0x001D) |
| Get Firmware | 0x1202 | - | [major, minor, patch] | e.g. `03 21 03` = 3.33.3 |
| Get Codec | 0x0800 | - | [codec_id] | See codec table below |
| Get Charging | 0x0602 | - | [status] | 0=disconnected, 1=charging, 2=complete |
| Get Battery | 0x0603 | - | [percent] | 0-100 |

### Codec IDs

| ID | Codec |
|----|-------|
| 0 | SBC |
| 1 | AAC |
| 2 | aptX |
| 3 | aptX Low Latency |
| 5 | aptX HD |
| 8 | aptX Adaptive |
| 9 | aptX Lossless |
| 10 | LC3 |
| 255 | None / disconnected |

## ANC

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set ANC Status | 0x1A04 | [0/1] | ack | Global ANC on/off |
| Get ANC Status | 0x1A05 | - | [0/1] | |
| Set ANC Mode | 0x1A00 | [mode, state] | ack | See mode table |
| Get ANC Mode | 0x1A01 | - | [m1,s1,m2,s2,m3,s3] | 6 bytes, 3 mode/state pairs |

### ANC Modes and States

| Mode | ID | States |
|------|----|--------|
| Anti-Wind | 1 | 0=off, 1=max, 2=auto |
| Comfort | 2 | 0=off, 1=on |
| Adaptive | 3 | 0=off, 1=on |

The 6-byte GET response always returns all 3 modes in order: `[01, s1, 02, s2, 03, s3]`.

## Transparency

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set Transparency | 0x1A02 | [level] | ack | 0-100 |
| Get Transparency | 0x1A03 | - | [level] | |

Transparency only works when ANC is on and Adaptive mode is off. If Adaptive is on, the headphones manage transparency automatically.

## EQ

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set EQ Band | 0x1001 | [band, gain] | ack | band 0-4, gain is int8 (dB x 10) |
| Get EQ Band | 0x1002 | [band] | [band, gain] | Per-band only; bulk GET (no payload) returns error |

Notification 0x1082 delivers all 5 bands at once when EQ changes.

### Band Frequencies

| Band | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| 0 | 50 Hz |
| 1 | 250 Hz |
| 2 | 800 Hz |
| 3 | 3 kHz |
| 4 | 8 kHz |

### Gain Encoding

Gain is a signed int8, representing dB x 10. So `0x14` (20) = +2.0 dB, `0xE0` (-32) = -3.2 dB.

### Presets (gain values as dB x 10)

| Preset | 50Hz | 250Hz | 800Hz | 3kHz | 8kHz |
|--------|------|-------|-------|------|------|
| Neutral | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Rock | 0 | 20 | 25 | 15 | -20 |
| Pop | 0 | -25 | 0 | 25 | 0 |
| Dance | 35 | 20 | -15 | 15 | 30 |
| Hip-Hop | 30 | 15 | -15 | 0 | -15 |
| Classical | -20 | -15 | 0 | 35 | 40 |
| Movie | 0 | 0 | 20 | 20 | -20 |
| Jazz | -32 | 0 | 22 | 22 | 0 |

## Bass Boost

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set Bass Boost | 0x1008 | [0/1] | ack | |
| Get Bass Boost | 0x1009 | - | [0/1] | |

## Podcast Mode

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set Podcast | 0x0803 | [0x00, val] | ack | val: 0x02=on, 0x01=off |
| Get Podcast | 0x0804 | - | [0x00, val] | |

The extra `0x00` prefix byte is always there. No idea why.

Podcast mode disables EQ and bass boost while active. When turning podcast mode off, you need to re-send the EQ band values to restore them.

## Sidetone (Call Transparency)

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set Sidetone | 0x0805 | [level] | ack | 0=off, 1-4 = levels |
| Get Sidetone | 0x0806 | - | [level] | |
| Set Auto-Pause | 0x1800 | [0/1] | ack | 0=keep playing, 1=pause audio when sidetone enabled |
| Get Auto-Pause | 0x1801 | - | [0/1] | |

Sending sidetone level 5 or higher returns an error. Only 0-4 are valid.

Auto-Pause (`TransparentHearing_Mode` in m4.json) pauses audio playback when Call Transparency / sidetone is activated. Discovered via packet capture of the iOS app.

## Crossfeed

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set Crossfeed | 0x2E00 | [val] | ack | 0=low, 1=high, 2=off |
| Get Crossfeed | 0x2E01 | - | [val] | |

The value mapping is counterintuitive: 0 is not "off" — it's "low." Off is 2.

## Settings

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Set On-Head Detection | 0x0400 | [0/1] | ack | Disables dependent features when off |
| Get On-Head Detection | 0x0401 | - | [0/1] | |
| Set Smart Pause | 0x080C | [0/1] | ack | Pause on ear removal (requires on-head detection) |
| Get Smart Pause | 0x080D | - | [0/1] | |
| Set Auto-Answer Calls | 0x080A | [0/1] | ack | Auto-answer incoming calls (requires on-head detection) |
| Get Auto-Answer Calls | 0x080B | - | [0/1] | |
| Set Comfort Call | 0x0814 | [0/1] | ack | |
| Get Comfort Call | 0x0815 | - | [0/1] | |
| Set Auto Power Off | 0x0600 | [0x00, sec_hi, sec_lo] | ack | Timer ID 0 = auto power off; seconds big-endian |
| Get Auto Power Off | 0x0601 | [0x00] | [0x00, sec_hi, sec_lo] | Common values: 0 (off), 900 (15m), 1800 (30m), 3600 (60m) |

On-Head Detection controls the proximity sensor. Disabling it automatically disables Smart Pause, Auto-Answer Calls, and Auto Power Off on the headphones. Re-enabling restores previous states from headphone memory.

## Connection Management

| Command | ID | Payload | Response | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Get Paired Device Count | 0x1400 | - | [count_BE 2B] | Big-endian uint16 |
| Get Device Info | 0x1401 | [index] | [idx, priority, connStatus, name...] | connStatus: 0=disconnected, 1=connected |
| Get Connection Status | 0x1404 | [index] | [idx, status] | |
| Get Own Device Index | 0x1407 | - | [index] | Which slot "this device" occupies |
| Get Max BT Connections | 0x1409 | - | [max] | Returns 2 on HDB 630 |

## Notification IDs

These are pushed by the headphones after you register for the corresponding feature. Notification cmd = GET cmd | 0x0080.

| Notification | ID | Feature | Payload | Notes |
|-------------|------|---------|---------|-------|
| ANC Mode | 0x1A81 | ANC (13) | [m1,s1,m2,s2,m3,s3] | |
| ANC Status | 0x1A85 | ANC (13) | [0/1] | |
| Transparency | 0x1A83 | Transparent Hearing (12) | [level] | |
| Battery | 0x0683 | Battery (3) | [percent] | |
| Charging | 0x0682 | Battery (3) | [status] | |
| Codec | 0x0880 | Generic Audio (4) | [codec_id] | |
| EQ All Bands | 0x1082 | User EQ (8) | [b0, b1, b2, b3, b4] | 5 signed int8 values |
| EQ Single Band | 0x1101 | User EQ (8) | [band, gain] | |
| Bass Boost | 0x1089 | User EQ (8) | [0/1] | |
| Podcast | 0x0884 | Generic Audio (4) | [0x00, val] | |
| Smart Pause | 0x088D | Generic Audio (4) | [0/1] | |
| Comfort Call | 0x0895 | Generic Audio (4) | [0/1] | |
| Connection | 0x1484 | Device Mgmt (10) | [index, status] | |
| Crossfeed | 0x2E81 | - | [val] | No push — polling only |
| Sidetone | 0x0886 | Generic Audio (4) | [level] | No push — polling only |

### No-Push Settings

The following settings don't fire push notifications and must be polled:
- Crossfeed, sidetone, auto-pause
- On-head detection, smart pause, auto-answer calls, comfort call, auto power off

We poll every 2 seconds while the popover is open.

### Mystery Notification

Notification 0x089A appears occasionally with payloads like `0xAC44` (44100) — looks like sample rate. Not handled currently.
